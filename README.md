# Quick Oh My Zsh Setup

This script provides an automated way to install **Oh My Zsh** and essential plugins, while intelligently selecting the best installation source based on internet connectivity. It supports both **GitHub** and **Gitee (China mirror)** for better accessibility.

## Features
- Automatically detects the operating system (Ubuntu/Debian or CentOS)
- Installs **Zsh**, **Oh My Zsh**, and essential plugins
- Checks Google connectivity to decide whether to use GitHub or a domestic mirror (Gitee)
- Installs useful plugins like:
  - `zsh-syntax-highlighting`
  - `zsh-autosuggestions`
- Sets Zsh as the default shell

## Prerequisites
Make sure you have `git` and `curl` installed. If not, the script will install them for you.

git clone git@github.com:NiceAsiv/quick-ohmyzsh-setup.git

The script will:
1. Check for system dependencies and install `zsh`
